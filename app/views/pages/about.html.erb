			<p><span class="bold">SRC Contractor</span> owner Mike Schumacher began construction as a framer at the age of 18.  He completed his Construction Management Degree and earned a job as a superintendent for a new construction company.  During that time he perfected his ability to install tile, wood flooring, trim work, and made some great relationships with many sub-contractors.</p>  
			<p>After seven years of new construction knowledge,  SRC was started and began the first remodel project for a District 66 homeowner who hired us to do a complete master bedroom and bathroom remodel.</p>
			<p>Since then we have added employees, equipment, and have built a business through repeat customers and referrals from past customers.  We show up on time, we clean up, and we finish the job every time.  Mikeâ€™s communication with the customer is key to a happy customer and he is on the job site.</p>  <p>Erin Schumacher works as the office administrator scheduling estimates and customer remodel projects.</p>
